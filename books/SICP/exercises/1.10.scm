; the other is (ack 3 3), but i aint doing it

; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

(define (f n) (A 0 n))

(define (g n) (A 1 n))

(define (h n) (A 2 n))

(define (k n) (* 5 n n))

; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the 
; procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n2.

f(n)
; m is 0, so it return n * 2
f(n) = 2n

g(n)
; m is 1, recursive call
g(n) = 2^n

h(n)
; m in 2, recursive call
h(n) = 2^(2^n)
