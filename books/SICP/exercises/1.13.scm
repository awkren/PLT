; Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to φ^n/√5, where φ = (1 + √5)/2. 
; Hint: Let 𝛙 = (1 - √5)/2. 
; Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section 1.2.2) 
; to prove that Fib(n) = (φ^n - 𝛙^n)/√5.

gave up on this, i think i need to show that the error margin is small enough to say
that Fib(n) can get rounded to φ^n/√5, but im stuck and cant progress, fuck this book
the error term is psi, i suppose... because phi grows exponentially, and psi does the opposite
